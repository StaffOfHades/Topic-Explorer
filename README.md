## Dev Notes

* The chosen libraries were selected to minimize the dependencies required to get a working bundle, while keeping the functionality required
* No hot loading nor development server were considered

### How to run app & test

* First, you need to install all the dependencies for the project with the following line in the terminal

  ```
    npm i
  ```

* The next step is adding your personal access token to the .env file

* To get a working bundle you can run the following line in the terminal

  ```
    npm run build
  ```
  
* Finally, to interact with the application you can open the html found in the following path

  ```
    dist/index.html
  ```

### Future Improvements

* Adding unit tests
